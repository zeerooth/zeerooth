## My departure from GitHub

In reaction to [recent news that GitHub is going to be fully absorbed by Microsoft's CoreAI team](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/goodbye-github/) I can't help but feel like this is the last straw in enshittification of this platform and I have no other choice but to fully commit to leaving it.

For some time now, GitHub feels like it became nothing much but a source of training data for Copilot, which is then pitched to execs and developers worldwide with euphemisms like *the greatest change to software development since the advent of the personal computer*. In my view however, Copilot like other LLMs from other big corporations are nothing but a plague on modern society, labour and culture. When junior software developer jobs are slashed in half, artists are getting fired en masse, with whoever remains being forced to use whatever AI tool the company they work for pays big bucks to, who do you think is the real winner here?

### What are the alternatives?

For junior developers GitHub is pitched as the ultimate platform for git itself, like you just have to use it to get any form of source control, but of course it can't be further from the truth!

Anyone can host their git instance with tools like [forgejo](https://forgejo.org/)

There are independent free software platforms that actually respect their users and [protect them from AI crawlers](https://social.anoxinon.de/@Codeberg/115033782514845941) like [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org)

And of course let's not forget about the OG way of git through email.

### Next steps

In the coming weeks will be moving all my repositories over to [my profile at Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/pekoedotsh) and purging as much of my data as possible from GitHub.

I don't know if this message will reach anyone, but I hope it can at least inspire you to reconsider your usage of this platform.
